# UC Berkeley Data Science W203 Portfolio

## Course Overview
This repository contains my coursework for UC Berkeley's Data Science W203: Statistics for Data Science. The course covers foundational and advanced topics in statistical inference, regression, and data analysis, with a focus on practical application using R and reproducible research practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop a strong understanding of statistical concepts and their application to real-world data.
- Gain proficiency in R and RMarkdown for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
- Apply best practices in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and communication of results.
- Build a portfolio of reproducible, well-documented analyses suitable for academic and professional review.

## Major Projects & Assignments

### Unit 01: Introduction to Statistical Thinking
- **Description:** Explored basic concepts in probability, sampling, and data visualization.
- **Key Skills:** RMarkdown, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis.

### Unit 02: Probability and Distributions
- **Description:** Applied probability theory and worked with common statistical distributions.
- **Key Skills:** Probability calculations, simulation, visualization in R.

### Unit 03: Statistical Inference
- **Description:** Conducted hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.

### Unit 10: Causal Inference
- **Description:** Analyzed causal relationships using experimental and observational data.
- **Key Skills:** Causal diagrams, potential outcomes, regression adjustment.

### Unit 11: Data Science in Practice
- **Description:** Applied statistical methods to a real-world YouTube dataset.
- **Key Skills:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, communication.

### Unit 12: Capstone Project
- **Description:** Synthesized course concepts in a comprehensive analysis project.
- **Key Skills:** End-to-end data science workflow, reproducibility, presentation.

## Technologies & Tools
- R, RMarkdown, ggplot2, dplyr
- Git & GitHub for version control
- PDF and HTML reporting

## How to Reproduce Results
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install R and required packages (see individual `.Rmd` files for package lists).
3. Open any unit's `.Rmd` file in RStudio and knit to HTML or PDF.

## Best Practices Followed
- Clean, modular code in `src/` for reusability.
- All analyses are fully reproducible and documented.
- No sensitive data or credentials are committed.
- Folder structure supports scalability and clarity.
